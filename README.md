- 👋 Hi, I’m @DerekLavington
- 👀 So i’m interested in coding, software design, investment analysis, and regulation of the financial services industry. I've previously been involved in projects spanning mmorpg client coding, server design, conversion of 3d object file formats, back office software for SIPP/SSAS operators, client data management software etc. Typically, I code in C99, VBA, PHP but will tolerate most languages (with the exception of Lisp and C++).
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on anything that's fun, interesting, and involves cool peepz with neat tricks, or at least a sense of humour.
- 📫 How to reach me is use my email dereklavington@gmail.com
