- 👋 Hi, I’m @DerekLavington
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, software design, investment analysis, and regulation of the financial services industry. I've previously been involved in projects spanning mmorpg client coding, server design, conversion of 3d object file formats, back office software for SIPP/SSAS operators, client data management software and, latterly a report writing app called pfBuilder. My interests extend to investment optimisation, data management within financial services and ofc, regulatory affairs (aka compliance).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, Julia coz it doesn't enforce object orientation, functional or any other faffy coding paradigm. It's also faster than Python, non indent sensitive and produces more elegant code. Typically, I code in C99, VBA, CLI PHP but will tolerate most languages (with the exception of Lisp and C++).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's fun, interesting, and involves cool peepz with neat tricks, or at least a sense of humour.
- 📫 How to reach me is use my email dlavington@leabold.co.uk.
